# Buse & Weimer (2010) - Learning a Metric for Code Readability

## Overview
This folder contains a representative Java snippet from the seminal study **"Learning a Metric for Code Readability"** by **Buse and Weimer (2010)**. 

## Dataset Significance
The original study involved **12,000 human judgments** from 120 annotators to define what makes code "readable". Unlike complexity metrics (e.g., Cyclomatic Complexity), these snippets focus on local, line-by-line features such as indentation, identifier density, and comment placement.

## Mapping & Ground Truth
| Global ID | Original Reference | Category | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **30** | Figure 1 | Readability Evaluation | A "neutral" snippet used to calibrate automated metrics against human judgment. |

## Usage for AI Evaluation
This sample is ideal for testing if an AI can mimic human perception of code clarity regardless of its logical complexity.
